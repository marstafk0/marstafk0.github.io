This is a small website for my SBA at TEKsystems. I used a library called Three.js to create earth, stars, atmosphere and animated mouse movements as well as glsl shaders for the index page.
I then implemented an api called Aeris Weather to send two string parameters to get the weather forecast information. While my CSS and over-all structure of th wesite is not super impressive,
I at least hope its entertaining and stylish.
